            🚫 This issue has been marked as "Won't Fix". Here's why:

            - The described behavior is working as intended
            - The request falls outside our project scope/goals
            - The cost/benefit ratio doesn't justify the change

            1. Share your additional context
            2. Propose alternative solutions

            🚫 此 issue 被标记为"不予修复"，原因如下：

            - 当前行为符合设计预期

            - 投入产出比不足以支持此变更

            如果您有任何新的想法或建议，欢迎：
